# README

Part of Le Wagon's bootcamp challenge to make a 2-model rails app. 
The app allows users to add restaurants and reviews.

User actions in the app:

1. As a visitor, I can see the list of all restaurants
2. As a visitor, I can add a new restaurant, and be directed to the show view of that new restaurant
3. As a visitor, I can see the details of a restaurant, with all the reviews related to the restaurant
4. As a visitor, I can add a new review to a restaurant
